# yolo-object-detection
This notebook creates a complete YOLO glasses detection system. It downloads a Kaggle dataset, processes images and annotations, splits data into test sets, trains a YOLO model with automatic GPU detection,evaluates performance metrics, visualizes predictions, and saves the trained model with comprehensive training reports for practical deployment.
